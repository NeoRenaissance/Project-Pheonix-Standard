EXHIBIT T: DEVICE UNIFICATION AND CONSUMER INTERFACE MANDATES

The "Universal Media Receiver" Classification and Interoperability Rules

1.0 THE CONVERGENCE DOCTRINE

The Petitioner asserts that the historic distinction between "Radio Receivers" and "Television Receivers" is an obsolete artifact of analog hardware limitations.

The Reality: Under the Phoenix Standard (IEEE 802.BC), both Radio and TV are simply data streams (Recursive GFDM) differentiated only by bitrate and codec (Opus vs. AV1).

The Mandate: The Commission establishes a new regulatory device category: the Universal Media Receiver (UMR).

2.0 PROHIBITION ON ARTIFICIAL SOFTWARE LIMITATIONS

To prevent anti-competitive behavior and ensure public access to the full spectrum, the Commission prohibits manufacturers from artificially restricting the capabilities of a UMR via software.

2.1 The "Open Scan" Rule
Any device classified as a UMR (including Televisions, Automotive Head Units, and Smartphones) must perform a Universal Band Scan upon setup.

Requirement: The scan must populate a single, unified "Service List" containing ALL discoverable broadcast services (AM, FM, and TV Bands) capable of being decoded by the hardware.

Prohibition: A Television manufacturer may not hide "Radio" channels to force users into proprietary streaming apps. An Automotive manufacturer may not hide "TV" channels (audio-only mode while driving) to force users into satellite subscriptions.

3.0 DEVICE CLASSIFICATIONS (FORM FACTOR, NOT FUNCTION)

While all devices share the same Universal Receiver Chip (ASIC), they are categorized by their output capabilities:

Class 1: The Micro-Receiver (e.g., "Lifeboat" Keychain, Wearables)

Hardware: Minimal screen (e-ink/OLED text) or Audio-only.

Capabilities: Decodes Audio Streams (Opus) and Text Data.

UI Behavior: Displays TV Channels as "Audio-Only" feeds (e.g., listening to the 6 PM News on a keychain).

Class 2: The Mobile Receiver (e.g., Phones, Tablets, Automotive)

Hardware: Touchscreen, high-mobility.

Capabilities: Decodes All Streams (Audio + Video).

UI Behavior: Full video support. Safety Interlock: Automotive units automatically switch Video streams to "Audio-Only" when the vehicle is in motion.

Class 3: The Stationary Receiver (e.g., Televisions, Home Theater)

Hardware: Large Format Display.

Capabilities: Decodes All Streams (Audio + Video).

UI Behavior:

TV Mode: Plays 4K Video.

Radio Mode: Displays "Visual Radio" (Album Art, Artist Bio, Lyrics) on the big screen while playing high-fidelity Opus audio.

4.0 THE UNIFIED "MEDIA GUIDE" (EPG)

The User Interface must present a converged Electronic Program Guide (EPG).

No Silos: "Channel 4" (TV) and "Channel 104.7" (Radio) sit side-by-side in the list.

Search: A search for "Football" returns the game on the local TV station AND the game on the local Radio station.

5.0 CONCLUSION

By erasing the line between "TV" and "Radio," we exponentially increase the utility of every device. A television becomes the best sound system in the house for music; a pocket radio becomes a way to listen to the breaking news on TV. This maximizes the public value of the spectrum.
