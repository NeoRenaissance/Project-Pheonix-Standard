EXHIBIT X: US-FIRST SILICON ARCHITECTURE

A Roadmap for Domestic Manufacturing of Phoenix Hardware

1.0 STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT: THE CHIPS ACT

The Petitioner asserts that the National Resilience Network (NGEAS) cannot rely on foreign-sourced silicon. To ensure supply chain security, the Phoenix Standard Reference Architecture is optimized for fabrication within the United States ecosystem (e.g., Intel, GlobalFoundries, Texas Instruments, SkyWater).

2.0 THE "PHOENIX CORE" ARCHITECTURE

We define a modular System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture that can be scaled from high-power transmitters to low-power keychains.

2.1 The Logical Blocks (Open IP)

To facilitate rapid manufacturing, the Government shall release the VHDL/Verilog definitions for the following core blocks:

The Wideband RF Front-End: A Direct Sampling interface covering 500 kHz – 108 MHz (AM/FM).

The GFDM Accelerator: A hardware logic block dedicated to the Recursive GFDM math (FFT/IFFT and Polyphase Filtering).

The Crypto-Enclave: A hardened block for AES-256 decryption (Government Zone) and Digital Signature verification.

The "Lifeboat" Wake-Up Core: An ultra-low-power logic gate that monitors 640/1240 kHz for the BPSK alert preamble.

3.0 MANUFACTURING TIERS

The roadmap targets specific US fabrication capabilities for different device classes.

Tier 1: The "Lifeboat" ASIC (The "Tic-Tac")

Target Device: Keychain/Emergency Radios.

Process Node: 45nm to 90nm Legacy Nodes.

Why: These nodes are incredibly cheap, fully depreciated, and widely available in US fabs (e.g., SkyWater in MN, GlobalFoundries in NY).

Volume: Hundreds of millions of units.

Cost Target: <$0.50 per chip.

Tier 2: The Consumer SDR (Automotive/Mobile)

Target Device: Smartphones, Car Head Units.

Process Node: 14nm to 22nm FinFET.

Why: Balances power efficiency with RF performance. Ideal for GlobalFoundries FDX or Intel 16.

Integration: Can be integrated as a "chiplet" or IP block into larger processors (Snapdragon/Apple Silicon).

Tier 3: The Infrastructure DSP (Transmitter Grade)

Target Device: Broadcast Exciters, SFN Nodes.

Process Node: High-Performance FPGA / 7nm Logic.

Why: Requires massive computational throughput for 4096-QAM active beamforming.

Manufacturer: Intel (Altera) or Xilinx (AMD).

4.0 ROADMAP TO SILICON SUCCESS

Phase 1: The FPGA Reference (Months 1-6)

Action: Release the full Phoenix RX/TX stack as an FPGA bitstream compatible with US-made FPGAs.

Goal: Allow immediate prototyping by broadcasters and auto manufacturers using off-the-shelf hardware.

Phase 2: The Multi-Project Wafer (MPW) Shuttle (Months 7-12)

Action: Government-subsidized "Shuttle Runs" for US design firms to tape-out prototype ASICs.

Goal: Verify the silicon designs for the "Lifeboat" chip.

Phase 3: High-Volume Ramp (Month 18+)

Action: Intel and GlobalFoundries initiate high-volume runs.

Goal: "Spitting them out like Tic-Tacs." Establish a strategic stockpile of Emergency Receiver chips before the legacy AM sunset begins.

5.0 CONCLUSION

By standardizing the "Phoenix Core" IP and aligning it with domestic legacy process nodes, we create a guaranteed customer base for US fabs and ensure that the nation's emergency infrastructure is Made in America.
