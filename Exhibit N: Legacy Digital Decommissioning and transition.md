EXHIBIT N: LEGACY DIGITAL TRANSITION AND DECOMMISSIONING

The Economic and Technical Case for "Flash-Cutting" from HD Radio

1.0 THE "IBOC PENALTY" ANALYSIS

The Petitioner notes that the legacy In-Band On-Channel (IBOC) digital standard imposes severe operational penalties on broadcasters:

Transmitter Stress: The High Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the IBOC signal forces transmitters to run at reduced efficiency, generating excessive heat and shortening component life.

Spectral Pollution: IBOC places digital sidebands outside the standard analog mask, raising the noise floor for adjacent neighbors and limiting the potential for new station allocations.

Cost: Proprietary licensing fees (iBiquity/Xperi) act as a tax on innovation.

2.0 THE "PHOENIX ADVANTAGE" FOR HARDWARE

Transitioning to the Phoenix Standard offers immediate hardware benefits:

Linearity Efficiency: Because the Phoenix signal (in Hybrid Mode) is contained within the baseband or strictly filtered within the channel mask, it requires less "headroom" than IBOC.

Power Savings: A transmitter running Phoenix Mode 2 (Hybrid Mono) operates significantly cooler than one running Hybrid IBOC, potentially extending tube/FET life by years.

3.0 TRANSITION PROTOCOL: THE "FLASH CUT"

Simultaneous operation of Legacy IBOC and Phoenix Recursive GFDM on the same frequency is Prohibited due to mutual interference. Broadcasters must choose a cutover date.

3.1 The Switch-Over Procedure

Step 1: Terminate IBOC Injection. The broadcaster disables the HD Radio exciter/importer.

Result: The digital sidebands vanish. The analog signal becomes cleaner. Adjacent interference drops to zero.

Step 2: Engage Phoenix Injection. The broadcaster enables the Recursive GFDM stream via the SCA/MPX input or a Phoenix-native exciter.

Result: The digital data capacity jumps from ~96 kbps (HD Radio) to ~2.1 Mbps (Phoenix Mode 2).

4.0 REGULATORY STREAMLINING (NOTIFICATION ONLY)

Current FCC rules require complex notifications for digital operations. We propose a simplified process:

The "Check-Box" Rule: A station currently authorized for Hybrid IBOC is automatically authorized for Hybrid Phoenix.

Notification: The licensee simply files a "Digital Standards Change Notification" (Form 335-D) within 10 days of the switch. No prior approval is required.

5.0 HANDLING LEGACY RECEIVERS

The Reality: While there is an install base of HD Radio receivers, consumer sentiment regarding their performance is generally poor (frequent dropouts, buffering).

The Trade-Off: The loss of legacy HD Radio service to a small number of vehicles is outweighed by the immediate gain of Universal High-Fidelity Service accessible to every smartphone and new car on the road via the Phoenix Standard.

6.0 CONCLUSION

The Phoenix Standard renders IBOC obsolete. It provides 20x the bandwidth at a fraction of the power cost. The Commission should facilitate the rapid decommissioning of IBOC to clean up the noise floor and pave the way for a truly modern broadcast infrastructure.
