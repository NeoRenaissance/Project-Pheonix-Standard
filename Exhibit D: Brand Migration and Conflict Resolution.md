EXHIBIT D: BRAND MIGRATION AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION (REV 3.0)

Utilizing the Pre-Auction Holding Period for Brand Transition

1.0 THE "NATURAL TRANSITION" DOCTRINE

The Petitioner notes that the administrative process of surrendering a broadcast license, cataloging it, and re-auctioning it typically creates a 12 to 24-month interval where the physical frequency is silent (The "FCC Holding Period").

We propose utilizing this natural delay as the primary transition window, eliminating the need for complex post-auction grace periods that burden new market entrants.

2.0 TIMELINE OF RIGHTS

Phase 1: The FCC Holding Period (The "Limbo" Phase)

Trigger: Incumbent Broadcaster consolidates to Digital Multiplex and surrenders the physical license to the FCC.

Status: The physical frequency is silent/unlicensed.

Rights: During this period, the Incumbent retains the exclusive right to use the Virtual Channel Number (VCN) "104.7" in their digital metadata.

Mandate: The Incumbent is expected to use this time to aggressively migrate their audience to a Name-Based Identity (e.g., "The Wave").

Phase 2: The Auction Gavel Rule (The "Hard Stop")

Trigger: The FCC creates a new construction permit and successfully auctions the license to a New Entrant.

Effective Date: The date the assignment of license is granted by the Commission.

Rule: On the Effective Date, the "Free Ride" ends. The Incumbent's right to the VCN "104.7" terminates immediately.

3.0 POST-AUCTION OPTIONS (The "Pay or Go" Choice)

Upon the Effective Date of the new license, the Incumbent faces a binary choice:

Option A: Immediate Relinquishment

If the Incumbent successfully rebranded during the FCC Holding Period:

They drop the "104.7" VCN metadata.

The New Entrant launches with exclusive rights to "104.7".

Option B: The Vanity Lease (VNLA)

If the Incumbent failed to migrate their brand or wishes to retain the number for legacy value:

They must immediately execute a Virtual Number Lease Agreement (VNLA) with the New Entrant.

Terms: The Incumbent pays the New Entrant for the right to keep displaying "104.7" virtually.

Leverage: Because the "Free Ride" is over, the New Entrant holds the leverage. If the Incumbent refuses to pay, the New Entrant takes the number.

4.0 CONCLUSION

This revised framework is superior because it aligns the transition with the physical reality of the spectrum.

Efficiency: It uses the "dead air" time of the auction process productively.

Fairness: The New Entrant receives a "clean" license on Day 1, unencumbered by legacy confusion, unless they choose to lease that right for profit.

Incentive: The Incumbent is motivated to rebrand quickly (while it's free) rather than dragging it out.
