EXHIBIT o: AI DISCOVERY AND PERSONALIZATION PROTOCOLS

The "Semantic Tuning" and Local Learning Standard

1.0 PHILOSOPHY: FROM FREQUENCY TO INTENT

The Petitioner notes that modern consumers utilize "Intent-Based" navigation (e.g., "Play 80s Rock," "Play Queen") rather than "Address-Based" navigation (e.g., "Tune to 104.7").

The Phoenix Mandate: To remain competitive, the terrestrial broadcast standard must support Semantic Metadata that allows an on-device Large Language Model (LLM) or heuristic engine to map User Intent to Broadcast Reality.

2.0 THE STATION VECTOR PROFILE (SVP)

Broadcasters are encouraged to transmit a Semantic Descriptor Block within their Station Heartbeat (Exhibit G). This is "Hidden Metadata" designed for machine ingestion, not human display.

2.1 Vector Contents

Key Artists: A weighted list of the top 500 artists played on the station (e.g., {"Queen": 0.9, "Bowie": 0.8, "Beatles": 0.6}).

Mood Descriptors: NLP-friendly tokens (e.g., "High Energy," "Commute," "Focus," "Nostalgia").

Genre Topography: Instead of a single genre ("Rock"), a granular map ("Classic Rock," "Arena Rock," "Glam Rock").

2.2 The "Intent Engine" (Voice Search)

When a user says "I want to listen to Queen," the receiver does not need to wait for a station to play a Queen song.

Analysis: The receiver's local AI scans the cached SVP of every station in the market.

Matching: It identifies that "104.7 The Wave" has a 0.9 weight for Queen.

Action: It tunes to 104.7 and informs the user: "Tuning to The Wave - They play a lot of Queen."

3.0 THE LOCAL LISTENER GRAPH (LLG)

To replicate the "Social/Algorithmic" feel of streaming without the privacy invasion, the Phoenix Receiver builds a Local Listener Graph.

3.1 Edge-Based Learning

Input: Every time the user listens for >30 seconds, "Likes" a song, or skips a station.

Storage: This profile is stored locally on the receiver's secure enclave. It is never transmitted to the cloud or the broadcaster.

Output: A personalized "Taste Fingerprint."

4.0 THE "SMART HOP" DISCOVERY ENGINE

Leveraging the Wideband Sentinel (Exhibit H), the receiver actively hunts for content on other stations that matches the user's Taste Fingerprint.

4.1 The Background Matcher

While the user is listening to a Talk station:

Scan: The Sentinel sees that "92.3 FM" just started playing "Bohemian Rhapsody."

Compare: The LLG recognizes "Bohemian Rhapsody" as a "Super-Like" song for this user.

Notify: A subtle "Toast Notification" appears on the screen:

"Playing now on 92.3: Bohemian Rhapsody (Queen). Tap to Switch."

4.2 Serendipity Mode

This creates a "Cross-Pollination" effect, encouraging users to discover new stations they would never have manually tuned to, effectively breaking the "Filter Bubble" of algorithmic streaming.

5.0 CONCLUSION

By embedding AI-ready semantic data into the broadcast and utilizing local machine learning, the Phoenix Standard transforms the radio dial from a static list of numbers into a dynamic, personalized feed that anticipates the listener's desires.
