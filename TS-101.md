TECHNICAL STANDARD TS-101 (CORRECTED)

Physical Layer: Recursive GFDM with Sonic/Supersonic Channelization

1.0 THE RECURSIVE ARCHITECTURE (THE FRACTAL MODEL)

The Phoenix Standard utilizes a nested modulation architecture. Unlike traditional FDM which places carriers side-by-side, Recursive GFDM creates independent modulated basebands before the final carrier modulation.

1.1 Baseband Segmentation

The 200 kHz channel is not treated as a single block. It is channelized into two distinct tiers based on the FM Baseband frequency domain:

Tier A (Sonic Carrier): 0 Hz - 20 kHz (Baseband Audio Range).

Tier B (Supersonic Carrier): 20 kHz - 100 kHz (Baseband Data Range).

1.2 Recursive Modulation Function

The total signal $S(t)$ is defined as the superposition of two independent GFDM fields, modulated onto the main broadcast carrier $f_c$:

$$S(t) = \text{Re} \left\{ \left[ \text{GFDM}_A(d_A) \cdot e^{j 2\pi f_A t} + \text{GFDM}_B(d_B) \cdot e^{j 2\pi f_B t} \right] \cdot e^{j 2\pi f_c t} \right\}$$

Where:

$\text{GFDM}_A$: The GFDM process for the Sonic Tier (optimized for robustness).

$\text{GFDM}_B$: The GFDM process for the Supersonic Tier (optimized for throughput).

$f_A, f_B$: The sub-carrier offsets within the channel mask.

2.0 SPECTRAL EFFICIENCY (THE 16 bps/Hz CALCULATION)

As established in prior analysis, the Recursive architecture allows for additive spectral efficiency because the sub-band filtering eliminates the need for internal guard bands between the tiers.

2.1 Efficiency Summation

Tier A (Sonic): Modulated at 64-QAM (Robust).

Efficiency contribution: $6 \text{ bps/Hz}$.

Tier B (Supersonic): Modulated at 1024-QAM (or 4096-QAM in high-SNR environments).

Efficiency contribution: $10 \text{ bps/Hz}$ (conservative).

Total System Efficiency:


$$\eta_{total} = \eta_{sonic} + \eta_{supersonic} = 6 + 10 = \mathbf{16 \text{ bps/Hz}}$$

2.2 Throughput Calculation

Applied to the 200 kHz FM Channel:


$$R_{data} = BW \times \eta_{total}$$

$$R_{data} = 200,000 \text{ Hz} \times 16 \text{ bits} = \mathbf{3.2 \text{ Mbps}}$$

3.0 CODING AND ERROR CORRECTION (ADAPTIVE RATE)

Recognizing the "Clarity" of the Recursive GFDM signal (high SINR due to channelized filtering), we reduce the FEC overhead to maximize payload.

Primary Code: LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check).

Code Rate: 7/8 (High Rate).

Rationale: The channelization inherently rejects noise, allowing us to dedicate more bits to data and fewer to error correction compared to legacy OFDM.

Fallback Code (Solar Storm): SCCC Rate 1/3 (only used during GMD events).

4.0 CONCLUSION

This standard defines a signal that is effectively "Two Channels in One," utilizing the recursive structure to achieve throughputs (3.2 Mbps) that physically exceed the capabilities of single-layer OFDM.
