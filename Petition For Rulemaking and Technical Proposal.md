BEFORE THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20554

In the Matter of
Modernization of the AM and FM Broadcast Bands
and Establishment of the Next Generation Emergency Alert System (NGEAS)

To: The Commission

PETITION FOR RULEMAKING AND TECHNICAL PROPOSAL

I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

The Petitioner respectfully submits this proposal, known as "The Phoenix Project," to request that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) initiate a rulemaking proceeding to modernize the technical standards of the Medium Frequency (AM) and Very High Frequency (FM) broadcast bands.

The current broadcast ecosystem faces a dual crisis: the economic and technical obsolescence of the AM band, and the spectral inefficiency of legacy digital standards. The Phoenix Project proposes a holistic solution: a voluntary, incentive-based migration of AM broadcasters to a new, high-efficiency digital FM standard, and the subsequent repurposing of the vacated AM spectrum for a dedicated National Resilience Network.

This proposal serves the public interest by:

Creating a Next Generation Emergency Alert System (NGEAS) that is terrestrial, redundant, and independent of vulnerable cellular and satellite infrastructure.

Unlocking the AM band for secure government communications (The Digital Resilience Zone) and community broadcasting.

Revitalizing the commercial broadcast industry with a software-defined digital standard capable of competing with modern streaming services.

II. THE PROPOSAL: A TIERED SPECTRUM STRATEGY

The Petitioner proposes a restructuring of the AM Band (530–1710 kHz) into three functional zones to maximize public utility.

A. The Public Safety Zone (NEAF)

We propose designating 640 kHz and 1240 kHz as the National Emergency Alert Frequencies (NEAF).

Purpose: To provide a "Lifeboat" audio alert service accessible by ultra-low-cost, mass-produced receivers.

Technical Standard: A Single Frequency Network (SFN) utilizing robust BPSK modulation for maximum signal penetration and ground-wave propagation.

Heritage: This restores the historical utility of the CONELRAD frequencies for modern civil defense.

B. The Digital Resilience Zone

We propose allocating the spectrum between 650 kHz and 1230 kHz for a secure, non-commercial government data network.

Purpose: To provide a secure, terrestrial alternative for government and military communications ("The Phoenix Network").

Technical Standard: A digital-only implementation of Recursive Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM).

Capabilities: High-throughput, encrypted data transmission utilizing carrier aggregation and active beamforming for resilience against jamming and physical infrastructure attacks.

C. The Community Zone

We propose reserving 1400 kHz through 1710 kHz for low-power, non-commercial community and educational broadcasting, fulfilling the Commission’s mandate to foster localism and diversity of voices.

III. THE FM MODERNIZATION AND LICENSE EXCHANGE

To facilitate the clearing of the AM band, the Commission should establish a Voluntary License Exchange Program.

Mechanism: Incumbent AM licensees may voluntarily surrender their licenses in exchange for a new digital authorization within the FM band (88–108 MHz).

Technical Efficiency: The proposed FM standard utilizes Recursive GFDM to enable multiple high-fidelity audio streams and data services within the existing 200 kHz channel mask, without causing adjacent-channel interference.

Public Safety Mandate: As a condition of the exchange, licensees must install NGEAS transceivers to automatically rebroadcast "Level 1" national alerts.

IV. CONCLUSION

The Phoenix Project offers a turnkey solution to modernize the nation's broadcast infrastructure. It aligns commercial incentives with national security needs, transforming a declining legacy asset into a robust shield for public safety. We urge the Commission to open a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to evaluate these technical specifications.
