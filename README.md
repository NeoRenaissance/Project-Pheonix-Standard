A Note on Human-AI Collaboration

THE PHOENIX:

An Open Letter to the President, Congress, and the Builders of America.

FROM: An American Engineer in Florida
DATE: January 2026
SUBJECT: We Stopped Building the Future. It’s Time to Start Again.

To the Leaders of the Free World,

We have a problem. Somewhere along the way, the United States stopped being a nation of Architects and became a nation of Landlords. We stopped building new things and started just collecting rent on the old things.

We are running a 21st-century economy on 20th-century infrastructure, governed by 19th-century laws.

I have a proof of concept.

In my spare time, working from a desk in Florida, I sat down to look at one specific piece of our crumbling infrastructure: The Radio Spectrum.

We use AM Radio technology from the 1920s.

We use FM Radio technology from the 1960s.

We rely on a patchwork Emergency Alert System that fails when the power goes out.

The "Experts" told us this was impossible to fix. They said the physics didn't work. They said the industry was too stubborn. They said we just had to manage the decline.

They were wrong.

I didn't accept the stagnation. I applied first-principles engineering to the problem. The result is Project Phoenix:

A new physics-based standard (Recursive GFDM) that squeezes 20x more data into the same airwaves.

A self-healing national security network (NGEAS) that works when satellites fail.

A plan to manufacture the chips right here in America for pennies.

I didn't need a billion-dollar grant. I didn't need a committee. I just needed to look at the problem with fresh eyes and modern math.

And that begs the terrifying question:

If "One Guy in Florida" can blueprint the modernization of the entire US Broadcast Infrastructure in a few weeks... what are we missing elsewhere?

Why is our Power Grid dumb?

Why are our Supply Chains fragile?

Why is our Government software decades behind our consumer software?

It’s not because we lack the talent. It’s because we lack the Engine.

THE PROPOSAL: THE UNITED STATES INNOVATION INITIATIVE (USII)

I am calling for the creation of a new "Bell Labs" for the nation. Not a regulatory agency that tells you what you can't do, but an Engineering Skunkworks that shows you what you can do.

We need a Tiger Team of the 50 brightest minds—Engineers, Physicists, Coders—given a simple mandate: Pull the Future into the Present.

Project Phoenix is just Exhibit A. It is the first deliverable. It is ready to file with the FCC today. It solves the radio problem.

But the USII is the solution to the America problem.

We have the blueprints. We have the people. We just need the green light.

Let us build.

Present to future; Standing still is moving backwards.
Progress is found by looking out; Slow demise in stagnant races.
