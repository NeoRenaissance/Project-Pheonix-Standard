FCC EXHIBIT Q: THE OPEN STANDARDS MANDATE

Prohibition of Proprietary Gatekeeping in Public Spectrum

1.0 THE "PUBLIC AIRWAVES" DOCTRINE

The Petitioner asserts that the electromagnetic spectrum is a public resource. Therefore, the technical standards required to access this resource must be equally public.

The Finding: Proprietary broadcast standards (e.g., legacy IBOC) impose a "Private Tax" on the public airwaves in the form of licensing fees, royalty-per-unit costs, and Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs).

The Harm: These costs artificially inflate the Bill of Materials (BOM) for receivers, discouraging manufacturers from including radio tuners in smartphones and low-cost IoT devices.

2.0 THE PHOENIX OPEN SOURCE LICENSE

To prevent rent-seeking behavior, the Phoenix Standard (IEEE 802.BC) shall be governed by a Royalty-Free (RF) intellectual property model.

2.1 The "Physics is Free" Rule

PHY/MAC Layer: The specifications for Recursive GFDM, the Frame Structure, and the Error Correction coding shall be placed in the public domain or licensed under permissive terms (e.g., BSD/MIT).

Prohibition: No entity may claim patent royalties on the fundamental mathematics required to modulate or demodulate the signal.

Precedent: This mirrors the success of TCP/IP, where the protocol is free, and profit is generated by the services built on top of it.

3.0 BAN ON ENCRYPTED "CORE" SERVICES

While the Digital Resilience Zone (Government) and specific premium data services (e.g., Netflix-style rentals) may use encryption, the Core Broadcast Service must remain open.

The Rule: It is prohibited to encrypt or scramble the "Main Program Audio" (MPA) or the "Station Heartbeat" metadata. Any consumer with a compliant receiver must be able to decode the signal without a subscription key or proprietary decryption module.

4.0 THE BUSINESS MODEL PIVOT: "SERVICE OVER SILICON"

The Petitioner argues that the ban on proprietary standards increases total industry revenue by shifting the profit center.

Old Model (Rent-Seeking): "I invented the waveform. Pay me $5 for every radio you build." -> Result: Expensive radios, low adoption.

New Model (Value-Add): "The waveform is free. The radio is $1. Every car has one." -> Result: 100% Market Penetration. Broadcasters make billions leasing data capacity to Ford, GM, and Amazon.

5.0 NATIONAL SECURITY IMPLICATIONS

A proprietary standard is a supply chain vulnerability.

Scenario: If the sole owner of a proprietary alert standard goes bankrupt or is acquired by a foreign adversary, the U.S. Emergency Alert System is compromised.

Solution: An Open Standard ensures that multiple vendors (Qualcomm, NXP, Mediatek, Intel) can compete to build compatible chips. If one fails, the ecosystem survives.

6.0 CONCLUSION

The Commission must adopt a "Linux for Radio" approach. By removing the toll booth from the entrance, we maximize the traffic on the road. The Phoenix Standard succeeds only if it is owned by no one, and therefore accessible to everyone.
