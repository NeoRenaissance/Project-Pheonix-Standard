EXHIBIT U: THE SPECTRUM DIVIDEND

Mandating Public Access to the Efficiency Surplus

1.0 THE "WINDFALL" ACKNOWLEDGMENT

The Petitioner acknowledges that upgrading a standard 200 kHz FM channel from analog (1 audio program) to Recursive GFDM (~3.2 Mbps data throughput) represents a massive Spectrum Windfall for the incumbent licensee.

Policy Statement: The Commission asserts that this efficiency gain—derived from the laws of physics and modern computing—is a public asset. While the licensee retains the rights to the frequency, they do not have the right to hoard the unused capacity created by this upgrade.

2.0 THE "USE IT OR LEASE IT" MANDATE

To prevent artificial scarcity, the Phoenix Standard implements an Automated Spectrum Market.

2.1 The "Capacity Flag"

Every Phoenix Transmitter must broadcast a real-time "Capacity Flag" in its header.

Example: "Station WXYZ is currently using 400 kbps for Audio. 2.8 Mbps is Available."

2.2 The Open Leasing Protocol (OLP)

Broadcasters must allow third parties to bid on and utilize this excess capacity via a standardized API.

Scenario: A local logistics company needs to update the GPS maps on their delivery trucks.

Action: Their server queries the local Phoenix Broadcasters.

Transaction: They instantly lease 1 Mbps from Station WXYZ for 10 minutes to push the update.

Result: The Broadcaster gets paid; the Spectrum is utilized; the "Windfall" becomes a market commodity.

3.0 THE PUBLIC DIVIDEND (THE "CIVIC SLICE")

As a condition of retaining the full 200 kHz bandwidth, the Licensee must dedicate a fixed percentage of the surplus capacity to Free Public Data.

3.1 The 10% Rule

Requirement: 10% of the total digital throughput (approx. 320 kbps) must be reserved for the "Civic Data Bus."

Usage: This bandwidth is managed by local/municipal governments or libraries to broadcast:

Real-time Transit Schedules (Bus/Train arrival times).

Public Library E-Book samples.

Air Quality / Environmental Sensor data.

City Council meeting audio feeds.

4.0 CONCLUSION

Instead of shrinking the license (The Old Way), we expand the obligations (The Phoenix Way). We allow broadcasters to keep their wide channels, but we force them to transform that bandwidth into a shared utility for the entire local economy.
