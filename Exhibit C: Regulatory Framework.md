EXHIBIT C: REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

Ensuring Market Competition and Preventing Spectrum Warehousing

1.0 THE "USE IT OR DIVEST IT" DOCTRINE The extreme spectral efficiency of IEEE 802.BC (Recursive GFDM) allows a licensee to consolidate multiple legacy stations onto a single 200 kHz assignment. To prevent anti-competitive "spectrum squatting," the Commission must enforce the following:

1.1 The Consolidation Trigger If a licensee chooses to multiplex multiple full-service stations (e.g., Stations A, B, and C) onto a single primary frequency (Frequency X):

Mandatory Surrender: The licensee must surrender the licenses for the vacated frequencies (formerly Stations A, B, and C) to the Commission within 12 months of successful multiplex activation.

Prohibition on Warehousing: Licensees are strictly prohibited from retaining "dark" or "data-only" broadcast licenses solely to block market entry by competitors. A broadcast license must primarily serve the public interest with free-to-air audio/video content.

1.2 The "Primary Service" Ratio To prevent broadcasters from becoming "dump pipes" for cellular offloading, we propose a strict capacity rule:

Minimum Broadcast Requirement: At least 70% of a license's total data throughput must be dedicated to free-to-air, public-facing content (Audio, Video, Emergency Alerts).

Data Leasing Cap: No more than 30% of the throughput may be leased for private, encrypted, or B2B data services (e.g., Firmware Over-The-Air, Cellular Offload).

2.0 VIRTUAL CHANNEL MAPPING (VCM) To incentivize consolidation without destroying brand equity, the standard supports Virtual Channel Mapping.

2.1 The Concept

Physical Layer: The broadcaster transmits on 101.1 MHz.

Logical Layer: The data stream contains metadata for three distinct stations.

Receiver Experience:

Listener tunes to "98.5": Receiver looks up VCM table, finds "98.5" content inside the 101.1 MHz stream, and plays it.

Listener tunes to "104.3": Receiver finds "104.3" content inside the 101.1 MHz stream, and plays it.

Result: The listener's user experience ("dialing in" their favorite number) remains unchanged, even though the physical transmission has moved. Brands are preserved.

3.0 THE "NEW ENTRANT" AUCTION The spectrum vacated by major broadcasters consolidating their signals must not be sold back to other conglomerates.

3.1 The Regional Diversity Set-Aside Frequencies surrendered under the Consolidation Trigger shall be placed into a restricted auction pool:

Eligibility: Restricted to entities that do not currently own a station in that market.

Priority: Preference points given to local owner-operators, minority-owned enterprises, and non-profit community groups.

4.0 PREVENTING NATIONAL MONOPOLIES The immense reach of the digital signal raises the risk of regional stations acting as national ones.

Geofencing Mandate: While the signal is digital, the content license is local. The standard includes Geofencing Flags. A receiver outside the designated Market Service Area (MSA) can be restricted from decoding sports content or syndicated shows if required by rights agreements, ensuring local advertising markets are protected.

5.0 CONCLUSION Technology creates the capacity; Regulation ensures the access. By enforcing "Use It or Divest It," the FCC turns the efficiency of Project Phoenix into a driver for diversity, allowing massive conglomerates to run more efficiently while simultaneously opening the door for a new generation of local, independent broadcasters to enter the market on the newly freed spectrum.
