EXHIBIT J: RAPID DEPLOYMENT VIA SCA INJECTION

The "Zero-CapEx" Pathway to Digital Modernization

1.0 THE "PLUG-AND-PLAY" DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

The Petitioner identifies a critical opportunity to accelerate adoption and field testing without requiring broadcasters to purchase new transmitters or antennas.

The Mechanism:
Virtually all legacy FM Exciters feature an auxiliary baseband input for Subsidiary Communications Authorization (SCA), typically centered at 67 kHz or 92 kHz.

The Proposal:
Broadcasters can inject the Recursive GFDM digital signal directly into this existing MPX input.

Cost: Near zero (requires only the digital signal generator).

Time: Instant deployment (no tower climbing required).

Interference: None. The signal sits high in the baseband (above 57 kHz), completely inaudible to standard analog radios.

2.0 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION (THE "TROJAN HORSE")

This mode allows for a massive, decentralized "Beta Test" of the Phoenix Standard.

Configuration: "SCA Mode" (67 kHz Center Frequency).

Bandwidth: ~14-20 kHz (fitting within standard SCA masks).

Modulation: Recursive GFDM / 64-QAM.

Throughput: ~100-150 kbps.

Note: While lower than the full 3.2 Mbps "Main Channel" mode, this is sufficient to transmit One High-Fidelity Opus Stream + Station Heartbeat Data.

Result: A broadcaster can be "On Air" with the new digital standard in 5 minutes.

3.0 PREVENTING FRAGMENTATION (THE STANDARDIZATION MANDATE)

While SCA Injection is the perfect entry point, it cannot be the end state, or the band will become a fragmented mess of proprietary subcarriers.

The Sunset Rule:
The Commission shall classify "SCA Injection Mode" as a Transitional Phase (Phase 0).

Standardization: Any digital signal broadcast via SCA must conform to the IEEE 802.BC PHY (Phoenix Standard). Proprietary, non-compliant digital signals are prohibited to ensure all receivers can decode the test streams.

Migration Trigger: Once digital receiver penetration in a market reaches 15%, the broadcaster is encouraged to migrate the digital signal from the narrow SCA subcarrier to the full Hybrid Mode 1 (as defined in Exhibit I), unlocking the full multi-megabit throughput.

4.0 CONCLUSION

By leveraging the dormant SCA ports found on transmitters across America, we transform a hardware upgrade cycle into a software update. This allows the Phoenix Standard to achieve nationwide coverage footprints months—not years—after authorization.
