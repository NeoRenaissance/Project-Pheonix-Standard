EXHIBIT M: RECEIVER-SIDE SPATIAL UPSCALING

Replacing Analog Bandwidth with Digital Processing Power

1.0 THE PHYSICS OF STEREO NOISE

The Petitioner notes that the legacy Analog FM Stereo system (Zenith-GE) introduces a significant "Noise Penalty."

The Penalty: Demodulating the L-R subcarrier reduces the effective Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) by approximately 23 dB.

The Consequence: A station that sounds crystal clear in Mono becomes hissy and unstable in Stereo at the fringe of its coverage area.

2.0 THE "MONO-PLUS" STRATEGY

By broadcasting in Mode 2 (Hybrid Mono), the broadcaster achieves two critical goals:

Spectrum Reclamation: Frees up the L-R bandwidth for ~1 Mbps of Digital Data.

Coverage Extension: The analog signal becomes robust and static-free out to a much further distance (the "23 dB Advantage").

3.0 SYNTHETIC SPATIALIZATION (THE "VIRTUAL SOUNDSTAGE")

To ensure the listener still perceives a premium, immersive experience, the Phoenix Standard mandates that all receivers include Spatial Upscaling DSP.

3.1 The Algorithm

When a receiver detects a Mode 2 (Analog Mono) signal, it automatically engages the Spatializer Engine.

Haas Effect Widening: Introduces micro-delays (10-30ms) to specific frequency bands to create a perception of width without phase cancellation.

Ambience Extraction: Analyzes reverb tails in the mono signal to simulate room acoustics.

Center Channel Focus: Anchors vocals to the center while pushing instrumentation to the virtual sides.

4.0 AUTOMOTIVE SYNERGY

Modern automotive head units already utilize complex DSP to manage cabin acoustics.

Integration: The Phoenix Receiver simply hands the clean Mono signal to the car's internal amplifier.

Result: The car's own "Surround Sound" processor creates a 5.1 or 7.1 mix from the mono source that sounds cleaner and more stable than the noisy legacy stereo signal ever did.

5.0 CONCLUSION

We are moving the "Stereo" from the Transmitter (where it wastes bandwidth) to the Receiver (where compute power is virtually free). This allows the broadcaster to send a bulletproof Analog Mono signal while the listener enjoys an immersive, simulated Stereo experience.
