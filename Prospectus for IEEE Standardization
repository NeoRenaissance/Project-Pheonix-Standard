PROSPECTUS FOR IEEE STANDARDIZATION

Proposed Working Group: IEEE 802.BC (Terrestrial Broadcast Data Services)

1.0 INTRODUCTION: THE GLOBAL OPPORTUNITY

Current terrestrial broadcast standards (HD Radio in the US, DAB+ in Europe, DRM elsewhere) are regionally fragmented and technologically stagnant. They focus primarily on audio delivery using modulation techniques from the 1990s.

The Phoenix Project (Recursive GFDM) represents a generational leap. By applying modern 5G-style waveforms (GFDM/FBMC) to High-Tower High-Power (HTHP) broadcast infrastructure, we can achieve spectral efficiencies ($>10 \text{ bps/Hz}$) that outperform all legacy standards.

We propose the formation of a new IEEE Study Group to standardize this physical layer (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layer for global adoption.

2.0 COMPARATIVE COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

The proposed IEEE 802.BC standard offers objectively superior performance compared to existing global systems:

Feature

DAB+ (Europe)

HD Radio (US - IBOC)

IEEE 802.BC (Phoenix)

Primary Modulation

OFDM / DQPSK

OFDM / QAM

Recursive GFDM / 4096-QAM

Spectral Efficiency

Low (~1-2 bps/Hz)

Low-Mid (~2-3 bps/Hz)

Ultra-High (10-12 bps/Hz)

Audio Codec

HE-AAC v2

HDC (Proprietary)

Agnostic (Lossless/Opus/Data)

Latency

High

High

Low (Active Beamforming)

Spectral Bleed

Moderate

High (Sidebands)

Near-Zero (Filtered Subcarriers)

Global Compatibility

Fragmented

Proprietary (iBiquity)

Open Standard (Global Silicon)

Conclusion: Europe’s DAB+ is robust but data-poor. The US’s IBOC is inefficient and proprietary. IEEE 802.BC is the only standard that leverages modern computational power to maximize data throughput.

3.0 ECONOMIC IMPACT: THE NEW BROADCASTER REVENUE MODEL

Standardizing this technology globally transforms the broadcaster from a "Radio Station" into a "Datacaster." This opens hundreds of new B2B and B2C revenue streams:

A. The Connected Vehicle Market

Firmware Over-The-Air (FOTA): Car manufacturers currently pay millions in cellular data fees to update vehicle firmware. A broadcaster can transmit a 2GB firmware update to every Tesla, Ford, and Toyota in a city simultaneously for a fraction of the cost.

Real-Time Traffic & Mapping: Broadcasting high-definition 3D map updates for autonomous driving systems (LiDAR maps) that are too large for standard cellular streaming.

B. The Smart City & IoT Utility

Digital Signage Updates: Updating every digital billboard in a metro area simultaneously without individual 5G subscriptions.

Agricultural IoT: Sending precision weather and soil data to farming equipment over vast rural areas where cellular coverage is weak (using the Digital Resilience Zone AM frequencies).

C. Consumer Content Offloading

Popular Content Pre-Caching: Instead of 100,000 people streaming the new Taylor Swift album individually (clogging cell towers), the broadcaster transmits the encrypted file once. User devices "catch" and cache it, unlocking it when the user presses play.

4K Video Broadcasting: Delivering live sporting events to mobile devices with zero buffering, bypassing congested stadium Wi-Fi.

4.0 THE PATH TO GLOBAL SILICON

An IEEE standard enables Economies of Scale.

Instead of a US-specific "HD Radio" chip and a Europe-specific "DAB" chip, manufacturers like Qualcomm and Broadcom can produce a single Global Broadcast Receiver modem.

This lowers the cost of the "Radio-First Android" device to near-zero, as the IP becomes a standard block in every Snapdragon or MediaTek processor, just like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are today.

5.0 CONCLUSION

Broadcasters have been fighting a losing war against streaming because they have been fighting with obsolete weapons. IEEE 802.BC gives them the "nuclear option": superior physics, global scale, and the ability to move massive amounts of data cheaper than any cellular provider.
