V. TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY AND PRECEDENTS

Bridging the Gap Between Legacy Broadcast and Modern Wireless Physics

The spectral efficiency claims of The Phoenix Project (specifically Recursive GFDM achieving >10 bps/Hz) represent a significant departure from legacy broadcast standards (e.g., IBOC). However, these metrics are consistent with the current state-of-the-art in non-broadcast wireless sectors. This proposal merely harmonizes terrestrial broadcast with the efficiencies already realized in cellular and local area networking.

A. Analogies in Existing Standards

The Commission need not view Recursive GFDM as unproven theory. Its performance characteristics are validated by parallel technologies currently under Commission regulation:

Comparison to Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax):

Precedent: Wi-Fi 6 standardizes 1024-QAM.

Application: The Phoenix Project applies this established modulation density to the FM band, utilizing the superior propagation characteristics of VHF compared to the 2.4/5 GHz ISM bands used by Wi-Fi.

Comparison to 5G New Radio (NR):

Precedent: 5G research and deployments utilize Filter Bank Multi-Carrier (FBMC) and Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) to reduce Out-of-Band Emissions (OOBE) and minimize guard bands.

Application: The Phoenix Project utilizes these exact same waveform shaping techniques to eliminate the "spectral bleed" that has historically limited the density of AM/FM digital signals.

B. The "Moore's Law" of Signal Processing

Legacy broadcast standards were designed for the DSP (Digital Signal Processing) capabilities of the late 1990s.

Legacy Constraint: Decoding a 4096-QAM GFDM signal would have required a supercomputer in 2000.

Modern Reality: Today, a sub-$5 commodity smartphone SoC (System on Chip) possesses the floating-point performance to decode Recursive GFDM in real-time. The "impossibility" of this standard in previous decades was a computational constraint, not a physical one. That constraint no longer exists.

C. Request for Experimental Special Temporary Authority (STA)

Recognizing the paradigm shift this technology represents, the Petitioner does not ask the Commission to mandate this standard overnight.

We respectfully request an Experimental Radio License (STA) to conduct a 12-month field trial.

Objective: To empirically demonstrate that a 200 kHz Recursive GFDM signal can operate at 4096-QAM without causing harmful interference to adjacent analog FM stations.

Test Bed: We propose a single-site deployment in a designated "Quiet Zone" or low-density spectrum market.

Deliverable: A comprehensive field report providing measured OOBE data, Bit Error Rate (BER) curves vs. SNR, and resilience data during simulated ionospheric disturbances.

Conclusion on Feasibility:
The physics of RF have not changed, but our ability to mathematically manipulate RF waveforms has. This proposal asks the Commission to allow the broadcast industry to catch up to the efficiency standards already set by the wireless broadband industry.
