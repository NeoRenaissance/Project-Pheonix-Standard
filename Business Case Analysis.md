BUSINESS CASE ANALYSIS: THE "SUPER-MULTIPLEX" STRATEGY Consolidating Market Operations via IEEE 802.BC (Recursive GFDM)

1.0 THE CAPACITY MATH Let's look at the numbers. Based on our Recursive GFDM standard (4096-QAM), a single 200 kHz FM channel provides approximately 3.2 Mbps of usable data throughput.

The "Cost" of Audio (Opus Codec):

Flagship Station (Top 40/Rock): 128 kbps (Perceptually Lossless)

Secondary Station (Oldies/Jazz): 64 kbps (High Fidelity)

Talk/Sports/News: 24 kbps (Wideband Speech - Crystal Clear)

2.0 HYPOTHETICAL MARKET CONSOLIDATION (Example: New York or Los Angeles) A major broadcaster typically owns 5-8 stations in a large market. Let's assume they own 8 stations and want to put them ALL on one frequency.

The Load:

3 Flagship Music Stations: 3 x 128 kbps = 384 kbps

3 Secondary Music Stations: 3 x 64 kbps = 192 kbps

2 Talk/News Stations: 2 x 24 kbps = 48 kbps

Total Audio Payload: 624 kbps

The Result:

Total Capacity: 3,200 kbps

Total Used: 624 kbps

Remaining Capacity: 2,576 kbps (~2.5 Mbps)

3.0 THE CONCLUSION The broadcaster has consolidated 8 separate transmitters (and 8 separate electric bills, 8 separate tower leases) onto ONE digital signal.

Even after putting every single station they own on that one signal, they still have 80% of the channel empty.

4.0 WHAT TO DO WITH THE EMPTY 80%? They don't need to cut niche streams. They can:

Launch 50 Niche Channels: Hyper-specific genres (e.g., "90s Grunge Deep Cuts," "Local Stand-up Comedy") at 48-64 kbps.

Lease Data Capacity: Sell the remaining ~2 Mbps to car manufacturers for firmware updates or to the city for smart-grid data.

Video: Broadcast a 720p video feed of their morning show.

5.0 THE REAL ESTATE PLAY The economic implication is staggering.

Old Model: Maintain 8 high-power transmitter sites scattered across the city.

New Model: Maintain 1 "Super-Multiplex" site.

Action: Sell or decommission the other 7 sites. Sell the land. Sell the copper. Stop paying the electric bills.

Summary: This technology turns a broadcaster from a "Landlord of Spectrum" (struggling to fill space) into a "Pipeline Giant" (with more pipe than they know what to do with). They can broadcast their entire portfolio + video + data, all from a single license.
