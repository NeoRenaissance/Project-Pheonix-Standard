EXHIBIT S: PUBLIC INTEREST OBLIGATIONS

Minimum Service Requirements and the "Community Uplink" Initiative

1.0 MINIMUM SERVICE MANDATE (THE "SAFETY FLOOR")

To ensure that the transition to the Phoenix Standard does not disenfranchise listeners, the Commission establishes the following baseline requirements for all licensees operating in Hybrid Mode:

Analog Continuity: The licensee must continue to broadcast the Main Program Audio (MPA) via the Analog Mono baseband (0-15 kHz).

Digital Simulcast: The licensee must broadcast a simultaneous, time-aligned digital version of the MPA (via Recursive GFDM) as the primary digital stream (Flow ID 0x01).

Free Access: Both the Analog and Primary Digital streams must remain unencrypted and free-to-air.

2.0 MAXIMIZATION OF AUDIO DIVERSITY

The Commission recognizes that the Phoenix Standard increases channel capacity by 20x. Licensees are strongly encouraged not to utilize this entire capacity solely for high-bitrate data or video.

Policy Statement: The Commission views the launch of additional audio sub-channels (Multicast) as a primary method of serving the public interest, specifically regarding:

Minority and Foreign Language programming.

Niche musical genres (Classical, Jazz, Folk) often underserved by commercial radio.

Educational and Civic programming.

3.0 THE "COMMUNITY UPLINK" PORTAL (DIGITAL LEASED ACCESS)

To foster hyper-localism, the Commission encourages (and may eventually mandate for Class B/C stations) the creation of a "Community Uplink" system.

3.1 The Concept

Broadcasters shall allocate a portion of their digital bandwidth (e.g., 5-10%) to create a "Public Access Multiplex."

3.2 The Mechanism (Web-to-RF Bridge)

The Portal: The broadcaster operates a standardized web portal.

The User: Local entities (High Schools, Churches, Town Councils, Little League distributors).

The Process:

The Community Entity logs in.

They pay a Nominal Fee (statutorily capped at cost-recovery rates, e.g., $10-$50/month).

They upload an audio stream or connect a live feed.

The Broadcast: The station's multiplexer automatically ingests this stream and broadcasts it as a "Community Sub-channel" (e.g., 104.7-HD9: "Westside High Football").

3.3 The Benefit

This effectively removes the "Barrier to Entry" for being on the radio. A local high school doesn't need to buy a $10M license to broadcast their football game; they just rent 24kbps of bandwidth from the local powerhouse for Friday night.

4.0 CONCLUSION

These obligations ensure that the "Digital Dividend" created by Recursive GFDM is shared between the commercial licensee and the community they serve.
